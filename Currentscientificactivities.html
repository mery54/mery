<!-- l. 238 --><p class='noindent'>My current scientific activities focus on proof-based developement of distributed algorithms
using the refinement, as well as modelling and certification of medical devices.
</p><!-- l. 242 --><p class='indent'>First, distributed algorithms, recently redeveloped by refinement, are population
protocols which are leading to extension of the refinement, and self-<span class='cmmi-12'>⋆ </span>algorithms.
The main difficulty is to deal with liveness and fairness properties, when considering
population protocols for instance, and with explicit assumptions as for instance oracles for
faults.
</p><!-- l. 249 --><p class='indent'>Second, medical devices lead to propose a refinement-based methodology applicable for
certification of cyber-physical systems and human-in-the-loop systems. Two collaborations
(NASA Ames and CHU Nancy) are interacting with us for these topics.
</p><!-- l. 256 --><p class='indent'>Finally, the IMPEX (http://impex.loria.fr) project leads me to deal with the integration of the
explicit semantics in proof-based development of software systems. Recently, I have obtained
two new projects ANR FORMEDICIS (2017-2022) on verification of HMI, extending
IMPEX, and ANR project DISCONT (http://discont.loria.fr) on hybrid models and
refinement.
