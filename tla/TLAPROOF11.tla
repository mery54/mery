VARIABLE x  (* The declaration of a variable named x. *)


Init == x = 0  (* The initial condition asserts that x starts equal to 0. *)
Next == x' = x + 1  (* The action Next asserts that x is incremented by 1. *)

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_x /\ WF_x(Next)  (* The temporal formula Spec asserts
    that variable x starts equal to 0, each step either leaves x unchanged or
    increments x by 1, and whenever a step that increments x and changes x
    remains possible, such a step eventually occurs. *)

            [Next]_x and starts from a state that satisfies the type invariant
            leads to a state that satisfies the type invariant.
            In other words, the type invariant is an inductive invariant. *)

asserts that Spec implies that eventually variable x equals the value m.
In this specification, m is a natural number, and P(m) will be shown to
be valid for every natural number. *)

                \A n \in Nat:  P(n) => P(n + 1). This becomes more evident if
