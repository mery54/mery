<P>
My current  scientific activities focus  on proof-based developement
  of distributed  algorithms  using    the refinement, as     well as
  modelling and certification of medical devices.

<P>
First, distributed  algorithms,  recently redeveloped by refinement,
  are population protocols  which  are  leading  to extension  of  the
  refinement,  and self-<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline4309#</SPAN> algorithms. The  main difficulty is to
  deal    with liveness   and   fairness properties,  when  considering
  population protocols for  instance, and with explicit assumptions as for instance 
  oracles for faults.

<P>
Second,   medical  devices  lead  to propose a  refinement-based methodology
  applicable  for   certification    of  cyber-physical  systems   and
  human-in-the-loop  systems.  Two   collaborations (NASA Ames and  CHU
  Nancy) are interacting with us for these topics.

<P>
Finally, the IMPEX (http://impex.loria.fr) project leads me to deal with the integration of
the explicit semantics in  proof-based development of software
systems. Recently, I have obtained two new projects ANR FORMEDICIS
(2017-2022) on verification of HMI, extending IMPEX, and ANR project
DISCONT (http://discont.loria.fr)  on hybrid models and  refinement.

<P>
